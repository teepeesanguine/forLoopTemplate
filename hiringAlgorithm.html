        <p>Welcome to MOOGLE, a well-known tech company that receives tens of thousands of job applications from graduating seniors every year.
        Since the company receives too many job applications for HR to individually assess in a reasonable amount of time, you have been asked to create a program that algorithmically analyzes applications and selects the ones most worth passing onto HR.</p>
